                  You stopped beating around the books, you’ve got your magical
                  idea, and not only that but you also worked hard and created a
                  product or service which you can't help but sit back, look at
                  and marvel over! Now you’re ready to start a new business.
                  Let's Cash In. <br />
                  <br />
                  Now you're at the stage of trying to figure out how to get
                  those initial sales.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The main problems you're facing now are an unfruitful web
                  presence, lack of time, and LACK OF FUNDS.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  There's a secret to solving all of these worrisome problems,
                  once and for all, which can be described in just one word:
                  Copywriter.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Just like an engineer fueling up one of those sci-fi looking
                  fighter jets that are ready for battle, a trained copywriter
                  can help prepare your business, fuel it with revenue and
                  launch your business from the grounds up.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The other important secret here is to NOT just get ANY
                  copywriter to take care of your business before taking off.
                  Instead employ a properly trained one!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  My name is Omar Khalil. I'm Well-Read, Trained and Certified
                  to get you all that you need for your business to compete..
                  From sales, leads, testimonials, surveys and more, I will take
                  care of all those things for you, so instead of exhasting your
                  energy ineffeciently, from this point on, you can comfortably
                  spend your time on perfecting your products. Make the market a
                  YES-fly Zone.

                    The Story of My First Marketing Experience
                  </h3>
                  <img
                    src={survey}
                    style={{ float: "left" }}
                    alt="survey picture"
                  />
                  <br />
                  Like most kids, my ambitions were big. But when I grew up, I
                  didn't lose my drive. <br />
                  <br />
                  at 18 years old, my ambitions were higher than the horizon.
                  Therefore, I moved from my small, little town in upstate New
                  York to Colorado, to reach the stars.
                  <br />
                  <br />I got on the plane from New York to Colorado with just a
                  phone, my drivers license and a luggage bag containing my
                  clothes, aside from about $600.
                  <br />
                  <br /> So, as soon as I got there, I hammered away with
                  fulltime jobs to secure my stay.
                  <br />
                  <br />I was a driven young man with an abundance of energy and
                  a knack for adventure. Yet, my first job was not ideal for me
                  at the time. <br />
                  <br /> I worked as a Salesman for The Kirby Company selling
                  high-end Vacuum Cleaners but I did not have the sales
                  expertise necessary to secure a sufficient income geting paid
                  on commission only. So, after three weeks, I moved on, in
                  search of a job with a stable wage.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  That's when I was hired at a marketing company called Black
                  Diamond Outreach, where I went canvassing on the field,
                  outside going from door-to-door with a tablet that had a map
                  and pinpoints of the locations I was assigned to survey.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  As a communicative person, the one thing that made me about 10
                  times happier at work was the opportunity to interview about
                  100 people each day. I chatted up people while giving them
                  surveys about political issues, then collecting their names
                  and email addresses. That was very easy for me, and I enjoyed
                  it and excelled at it. Splendid.

                  When I started working I wanted to do my best and prove my
                  capabilities, and, indeed, I was Awarded Best Employee for 3
                  days in a row, in an office of over 30 people. On the fourth
                  day, I finally took my finger off the tablet and slowed down a
                  bit to let others get awarded as well and as to not demoralize
                  my colleagues. Because others need their smoothies too.

                  With my marketing experience and ability to interview people
                  effectively, I can provide you with testimonials, customized
                  surveys and qualified leads. In doing so, you close sales as
                  you put your finger on the pulse of your market, understand
                  your business better and have leads for followup marketing. By
                  having that better understanding of your business and market ,
                  you can, also, improve your product or service and get paid
                  better.

                From when I was a salesman driving in a van with a team of
                salespeople for The Kirby Company demonstrating and selling
                high-end Vacuum Cleaners in Colorado Springs, to collaborating
                on software engineering projects via Slack with fellow software
                developers more recently, I've been in several situations where
                I worked, on a regular basis, in a team environment and
                collaborated with other people. I enjoy benefiting from the
                expertise of my colleagues. <br />
                <br />
                I am social and love networking with people. I'm easy-going,
                funny, yet professional and can properly communicate and have
                excellent people skills. Like the Good Guy Greg of copywriting,
                I treat every business acquaintance as a human being. I
                genuinely want your business to succeed and reach its fullest
                potential. Your success matter to me.
                <br />
                <br />
                You enjoy your business operations more working with someone

                  Technology is getting out of hands. So isn't it best to work
                  with a modern Copywriter who knows tech?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I started engineering software since 14 years old by
                  self-teaching. Then, I took Computer Science classes at New
                  Paltz High School, to learn even more about software
                  engineering.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In 2022, I’ve completed General Assembly’s Software
                  Engineering Bootcamp, and you're free to check out my{" "}

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I orient my software development learning around
                  entrepreneurship and I'm consistently learning new
                  technologies and development techniques, practicing my skills
                  and improving my software development abilities.

                  Being a Full Stack Software Engineer, I can develop for the
                  Client-Side and Server-Side of a website. I know how to design
                  the websites layout, graphics and client-side of the
                  application as well as the behind the scenes functionality of
                  the website. And I can also create databases and much more.

                  <br />
                  Even this website is created by me!

                  <br />
                  When you work with such a tech savvy copywriter you can rest
                  easy knowing they understand the technical mechanics of your
                  online business to make marketing operations run smoother. As
                  well as helping you build a smarter, more effective marketing

                I have 100s of business ideas. I’ve written copy for many
                businesses of mine and I can write copy for just about any
                business idea.
                <br />
                <br /> Robert Kiyosaki suggested in ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad,’ that
                working for experience leads to more monetary success than
                working for money. So when I can make a positive impact on the
                success of your business, I gain valuable experience. Thus,
                whatever your business is about, I will go aboce and beyond to
                provide you with as much money as possible.

                While I can read, write and speak English fluently, My native
                language is Arabic. Some people assume that non-native English
                speakers are not as capable than native speakers. Yet, research
                shows that being bilingual comes with some exlusive strengths.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                Studies have shown that bilingual individuals outperform
                monolinguals in problem solving and perceptual focusing. With
                more tools for self-expression and unique capabilities, I can
                write one-of-a-kind copy that grabs MORE attention, inspires
                MORE interest, builds MORE desire and gets MORE prospects to
                take ACTION.
