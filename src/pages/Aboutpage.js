              I'm Omar Khalil, a copywriter, software developer, entrepreneur
              and the business owner of Khalil's Marketing. I'm a typology nerd,
              martial arts enthusiast, soccer player, and a music production
              hobbyist. I have had some experience working in a marketing
              organization as well as a salesperson. Very Recently I've
              completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp. Yet,
              instead of becoming a software developer I found it important for
              my entrepreneurial strategy to master copywriting, content writing
              and related fields.
